# Might &amp; Might 6 Game Save Editor

## Background
Along with my EasyUO miner automation, this was the other project I had as a kid that was way out of my league to tackle at the time that I wish to revisit.

I understand this game is ancient. That this was done even when this was played. However, I wish to do it myself to learn.

## Considered features

I do not remember specifically what I was hoping to accomplish except maybe to be able to edit player data and the inventory? I did not get quite far because I was trying to convert hex to ascii in a notebook using printed out hex dumps of the save files.

Depending on how easy it is, might also try to do teleportation, quest data manipulation, etc.

## Solution design

I will probably do this as a GUI app with some toggles. Have an import and export file option.
